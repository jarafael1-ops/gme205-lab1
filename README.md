------3.5 REFLECTION Computational Thinking Lenses 
1. Abstraction- I choose to inspect the object csv file
first,  to check the file PATH and to ensure if the imported correctly.This step is critical because without confirming if the path are successful import, the script cannot read or process any of the data.   
second, --------for Representation I assumed that CSV uses is consistent for the basic information if there is propoer headers and coordinates was expressed in decimal degrees (latitude/longitude). The script allow to interpret the data.
third, ----- for Responsibilty the script should copy was automatically check for formatting errors, like missing value and coordinates ranges, while a human should verify the data to make sense for (e.g. locations are possible and relavant).
lastly the Scale---- If the datasets becomes very large
