------3.5 REFLECTION Computational Thinking Lenses 
1. Abstraction- I choose to inspect the object CSV file
first,  to check the file PATH, and to ensure if the imported correctly. This step is critical because without confirming if the path are successful import, the script cannot read or process any of the data.   
Second, --------for Representation I assumed that CSV uses are consistent for the basic information if there is propoer headers and coordinates are expressed in decimal degrees (latitude/longitude). The script allows to interpret the data.
Third, ----- for Responsibilty the script should copy was automatically check for formatting errors, like missing values and coordinate ranges, while a human should verify the data to make sense (e.g., locations are possible and relevant).
lastly the Scale---- If the datasets become very large, performance issues may appear to slow processing, the memory may be overloaded, or there may be difficulty in visualization. The large datasets also increase the risk of hidden anomalies that automated checks might overlook, requiring sampling and human review.
